            <article>
                <p>Forgotten Roast is a rich meat dish with a creamy sauce. It's a fairly simple 
                recipe capable of feeding many heads with about 30 minutes of prep time.
                You must plan in advance as the recipe takes at least 5 hours of cook time.
                It can be done in a crock pot, but for best results use your oven(It tastes 
                way better). 
                </p>
